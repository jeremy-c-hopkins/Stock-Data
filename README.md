With the large availability of **free data** related to the stock market, it's becoming much easier for **retail investors** to have access to the information they need. However, **return on investment** on average is **lower** than it has ever been for these same individuals. This is theorized to be due to all the extra "information" that is being published. With **media** more focused on **click rates** and **retention**, the quality of information may have decreased. 

My goal is to **numerically assess** the value of an **equity**, and publish the **code** base and **data** used to come to this calculation for **public** use. This may eventually be wrapped into one code **package**, however, the current focus is on **accuracy** and low **computation time**. Outside of generally producing quality predictions and collecting useful data, I also hope to develop a solid method of passing data between spreadsheets and code to utilize the strengths of both styles of research. ðŸš€
